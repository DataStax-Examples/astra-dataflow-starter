THE FLY AND THE GAME;1;A knight of powder-horn and shot
THE FLY AND THE GAME;2;Once fill'd his bag--as I would not,
THE FLY AND THE GAME;3;Unless the feelings of my breast
THE FLY AND THE GAME;4;By poverty were sorely press'd--
THE FLY AND THE GAME;5;With birds and squirrels for the spits
THE FLY AND THE GAME;6;Of certain gormandizing cits.
THE FLY AND THE GAME;7;With merry heart the fellow went
THE FLY AND THE GAME;8;Direct to Mr. Centpercent,
THE FLY AND THE GAME;9;Who loved, as well was understood,
THE FLY AND THE GAME;10;Whatever game was nice and good.
THE FLY AND THE GAME;11;This gentleman, with knowing air,
THE FLY AND THE GAME;12;Survey'd the dainty lot with care,
THE FLY AND THE GAME;13;Pronounced it racy, rich, and rare,
THE FLY AND THE GAME;14;And call'd his wife, to know her wishes
THE FLY AND THE GAME;15;About its purchase for their dishes.
THE FLY AND THE GAME;16;The lady thought the creatures prime,
THE FLY AND THE GAME;17;And for their dinner just in time
THE FLY AND THE GAME;18;So sweet they were, and delicate,
THE FLY AND THE GAME;19;For dinner she could hardly wait.
THE FLY AND THE GAME;20;But now there came--could luck be worse?--
THE FLY AND THE GAME;21;Just as the buyer drew his purse,
THE FLY AND THE GAME;22;A bulky fly, with solemn buzz,
THE FLY AND THE GAME;23;And smelt, as an inspector does,
THE FLY AND THE GAME;24;This bird and that, and said the meat--
THE FLY AND THE GAME;25;But here his words I won't repeat--
THE FLY AND THE GAME;26;Was anything but fit to eat.
THE FLY AND THE GAME;27;'Ah!' cried the lady, 'there's a fly
THE FLY AND THE GAME;28;I never knew to tell a lie
THE FLY AND THE GAME;29;His coat, you see, is bottle-green
THE FLY AND THE GAME;30;He knows a thing or two I ween
THE FLY AND THE GAME;31;My dear, I beg you, do not buy:
THE FLY AND THE GAME;32;Such game as this may suit the dogs.'
THE FLY AND THE GAME;33;So on our peddling sportsman jogs,
THE FLY AND THE GAME;34;His soul possess'd of this surmise,
THE FLY AND THE GAME;35;About some men, as well as flies:
THE FLY AND THE GAME;36;A filthy taint they soonest find
THE FLY AND THE GAME;37;Who are to relish filth inclined.
